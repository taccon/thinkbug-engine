### A dead-simple bug tracker API

This project wants to offer a very simple bug tracker that is basically just a RESTful API.

Currently, this is just a bloody start of something that is:

* based on [Lumen microframework](https://lumen.laravel.com)
* inspired by [thinkBug](https://www.viathinksoft.de/thinkbug)
* going to be easily extendable
* going to be usable internally (VPN) or publicly (authentication handler is provided by Lumen)

Let's see where this leads... :)
